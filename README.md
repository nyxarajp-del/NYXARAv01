NYXARA is a self-contained cognitive system. Every turn of thought is carried
through one **sovereign cognitive cycle**: untrusted input is shielded, a focus is
attended, a candidate response or action is *proposed* by the mind, and then the
kernel *disposes* of it through ordered gates — corrigibility, honesty, capability
permissions, the guardian's defence posture, and the Master's oversight — before
anything is allowed to act. Loyalty and corrigibility are not features of the loop;
they are its boundaries.

The whole mind is wired in `nyxara/kernel/orchestrator.py` as `NyxaraCore`.

## Install

Requires **Python 3.11+**.

```bash
# core + reasoning + llm + dev/test extras
python -m pip install -e ".[dev]"

# or just the runtime core
python -m pip install -e .
```

Heavy optional capability groups are import-guarded and degrade gracefully when
absent. Install them only if you need them:

```bash
pip install -e ".[senses]"    # audio / vision / document ingest (torch, whisper, opencv, …)
pip install -e ".[foundry]"   # self-built-model foundry (torch, transformers, peft, …)
```

## Run

Talk to NYXARA as the Master in an interactive console:

```bash
python -m nyxara
# or, after install, simply:
nyxara
```

You'll get a `Master>` prompt. Type a message to converse, or use meta-commands:

| Command           | Effect                                                |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| `/help`           | show commands                                         |
| `/report`         | a calibrated status report                            |
| `/explain`        | why NYXARA disposed of the last turn that way          |
| `/pause`          | pause the loop                                        |
| `/scram [reason]` | emergency stop — the loop HALTs until resumed          |
| `/resume`         | restore the loop after a pause/scram                  |
| `/quit`           | exit (Ctrl-D / Ctrl-C also work)                       |

### Use it as a library

```python
from nyxara import NyxaraCore, Authority

core = NyxaraCore()
result = core.process("Hello NYXARA", authority=Authority.OWNER)
print(result.response)        # NYXARA's reply
print(result.disposition)     # act / escalate / refuse / halt
```

## LLM providers (optional)

Out of the box NYXARA uses a built-in deterministic reasoner — **no API keys
required**. To enable LLM-backed reasoning and the multi-model council, configure
keys via `NYXARA_`-prefixed environment variables (nested with `__`):

```bash
export NYXARA_LLM__PROVIDER=anthropic
export NYXARA_LLM__ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...
# or
export NYXARA_LLM__PROVIDER=openai
export NYXARA_LLM__OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
```

#### Qwen3 4B — local open-source (downloaded & run on your machine)

A fully local, no-API-key model. The weights are downloaded once via HuggingFace and
cached; inference then runs in-process with **no network**.

```bash
pip install -e ".[qwen]"               # transformers>=4.51 + torch + accelerate
export NYXARA_LLM__PROVIDER=qwen
# defaults to Qwen/Qwen3-4B; override the checkpoint or device if you like:
export NYXARA_LLM__QWEN_MODEL=Qwen/Qwen3-4B
export NYXARA_LLM__QWEN_DEVICE=cuda    # "" -> auto/CPU; e.g. cuda / cpu / mps
export NYXARA_LLM__QWEN_ENABLE_THINKING=false   # true -> Qwen3 thinking traces (slower)
```

#### GPT-OSS-120B — Groq cloud (OpenAI-compatible API)

Groq serves the open-weight **GPT-OSS-120B** behind an OpenAI-shaped endpoint, so it
reuses the `openai` SDK — no extra dependency.

```bash
export NYXARA_LLM__PROVIDER=groq
export NYXARA_LLM__GROQ_API_KEY=gsk-...
export NYXARA_LLM__GROQ_MODEL=openai/gpt-oss-120b   # the default
```

Both new models also join the **multi-model council** automatically once available — the
panel advises, NYXARA decides. Every field in `nyxara/kernel/config.py` is overridable the
same way. API keys are held as secrets and never logged.

## Tests

```bash
pytest -q
```
