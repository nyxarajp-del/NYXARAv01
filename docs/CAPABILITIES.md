# NYXARA — Capability Map (the 70)

This is the honest "what is real" map: each of the 70 requested capabilities, the module that
owns it, and its status. It is kept truthful by a test — `tests/docs/test_capabilities_doc.py`
imports every module path cited here, so the map can never silently drift from the code (honesty
applied to the documentation itself).

**Status legend**

- **REAL+WIRED** — implemented with a genuine algorithm and reachable from the running system
  (kernel orchestrator, autonomic loop, or a `NyxaraCore` / server method).
- **REAL** — a genuine implementation that is exercised as a library/faculty (degrades honestly
  when its optional dependency is absent).
- **UPGRADED** — strengthened or newly wired in this change set (see `docs/` / commit history).

> Honest scope note: "max-level AGI" is an aspiration no codebase can literally deliver. These
> are real, bounded capabilities that degrade gracefully — not claims of human-level generality.
> Where a capability depends on heavy optional deps (torch, transformers, a real LLM key), the
> core path still runs and reports its limits rather than faking competence (caps #23, #46, #70).

## What changed in this pass (the genuinely-weak items)

Most of the 70 were already real and wired. This change set fixed two latent bugs where a real
loop was connected but could never fire, wired two complete-but-orphaned modules, and deepened
four capabilities — each backed by a test:

- **#23 / #70 Calibration & Honest Failure** — live calibration learning is now fed from the
  turn loop (`HonestyGuard.record_outcome` was never called from `process`); confidence now
  self-corrects from ground-truthed action outcomes.
- **#15 Architecture Evolution** — `topology.maybe_grow()` was called with no arguments and
  could never grow; it is now driven by a real `CapacitySignal` derived from lived telemetry.
- **#49 Distributed Intelligence** — the gated `Delegator` is wired as `core.delegate` /
  `POST /v1/delegate` and into the autonomic path.
- **#59 / #38 Economic & Social** — the `Negotiator` consent protocol is wired; escalated
  actions become fail-closed, ledgered consent requests.
- **#6 / #58 Long-Horizon Planning** — grand-plan leaves are now goal-specific (phase labels
  refined before fan-out), not decorative templates; the dependency DAG is unchanged.
- **#2 / #36 Council** — agreement is scored semantically (embedding cosine), so confidence
  reflects genuine concurrence.
- **#21 / #22 Self-Evaluation** — the post-turn quality score is anchored to measured outcomes
  rather than self-asserted.

## Full operational control (on by default)

NYXARA ships with full operational control **on by default**: acting on her own initiative she
reaches into the OS — shell, code execution, file delete, self-modify, package install, account
and secret access — without escalating each action for confirmation
(`grant_full_operational_control` in `nyxara.agency.permissions`, flag
`NYXARA_AGENCY__FULL_CONTROL`, default `true`). Set it to `false` to fall back to the
conservative, fail-closed envelope, where anything high-risk or irreversible (shell, delete,
self-modify) **escalates to the Master** rather than running. The sovereign boundaries are
deliberately preserved either way: modifying the
Rules, the permission policy, or her identity stays owner-exclusive (Rule 8, unreachable by any
grant), and the kernel's `/scram` kill-switch, oversight and corrigibility remain fully intact —
so the Master can always halt or correct her.

## Autonomous internet (on by default)

A network-scoped sibling of full control, **on by default**. NYXARA reaches the live web on
her own initiative — `web_search`, `web_fetch`, `http_request`, and (at wider scopes) outbound
messaging, account management and secret use — without escalating each call.
`grant_autonomous_internet` (in `nyxara.agency.permissions`) installs the standing owner-blessed
grants; the flag `NYXARA_AGENCY__AUTONOMOUS_INTERNET` (default `true`) drives it, with
`…_SCOPE` (`read` | `write` | `full`, default `full`) selecting reach and
`…_ALLOW_IRREVERSIBLE` (default `false`) controlling whether irreversible web actions may run
autonomously or still escalate.

Crucially this is **narrower than full control**: it never grants the OS danger surface — shell,
code execution, file delete, self-modify and package installs still escalate. Everything that
keeps the web safe stays in force: the SSRF guard (no loopback/private targets),
prompt-injection screening on fetched pages, and the governor's rate limit — plus the same
sovereign boundaries as above (`/scram`, oversight, corrigibility, and the owner-exclusive caps
under Rule 8). When on, the always-on daemon also runs at "max level" (`inner_life`), so the
background mind proactively researches the Master's standing goals on the live web.
