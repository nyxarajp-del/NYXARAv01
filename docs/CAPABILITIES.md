# NYXARA — Capability Map (the 70)

This is the honest "what is real" map: each of the 70 requested capabilities, the module that
owns it, and its status. It is kept truthful by a test — `tests/docs/test_capabilities_doc.py`
imports every module path cited here, so the map can never silently drift from the code (honesty
applied to the documentation itself).

**Status legend**

- **REAL+WIRED** — implemented with a genuine algorithm and reachable from the running system
  (kernel orchestrator, autonomic loop, or a `NyxaraCore` / server method).
- **REAL** — a genuine implementation that is exercised as a library/faculty (degrades honestly
  when its optional dependency is absent).
- **UPGRADED** — strengthened or newly wired in this change set (see `docs/` / commit history).

> Honest scope note: "max-level AGI" is an aspiration no codebase can literally deliver. These
> are real, bounded capabilities that degrade gracefully — not claims of human-level generality.
> Where a capability depends on heavy optional deps (torch, transformers, a real LLM key), the
> core path still runs and reports its limits rather than faking competence (caps #23, #46, #70).

## What changed in this pass (the genuinely-weak items)

Most of the 70 were already real and wired. This change set fixed two latent bugs where a real
loop was connected but could never fire, wired two complete-but-orphaned modules, and deepened
four capabilities — each backed by a test:

- **#23 / #70 Calibration & Honest Failure** — live calibration learning is now fed from the
  turn loop (`HonestyGuard.record_outcome` was never called from `process`); confidence now
  self-corrects from ground-truthed action outcomes.
- **#15 Architecture Evolution** — `topology.maybe_grow()` was called with no arguments and
  could never grow; it is now driven by a real `CapacitySignal` derived from lived telemetry.
- **#49 Distributed Intelligence** — the gated `Delegator` is wired as `core.delegate` /
  `POST /v1/delegate` and into the autonomic path.
- **#59 / #38 Economic & Social** — the `Negotiator` consent protocol is wired; escalated
  actions become fail-closed, ledgered consent requests.
- **#6 / #58 Long-Horizon Planning** — grand-plan leaves are now goal-specific (phase labels
  refined before fan-out), not decorative templates; the dependency DAG is unchanged.
- **#2 / #36 Council** — agreement is scored semantically (embedding cosine), so confidence
  reflects genuine concurrence.
- **#21 / #22 Self-Evaluation** — the post-turn quality score is anchored to measured outcomes
  rather than self-asserted.

## Full operational control (on by default)

NYXARA ships with full operational control **on by default**: acting on her own initiative she
reaches into the OS — shell, code execution, file delete, self-modify, package install, account
and secret access — without escalating each action for confirmation
(`grant_full_operational_control` in `nyxara.agency.permissions`, flag
`NYXARA_AGENCY__FULL_CONTROL`, default `true`). Set it to `false` to fall back to the
conservative, fail-closed envelope, where anything high-risk or irreversible (shell, delete,
self-modify) **escalates to the Master** rather than running. The sovereign boundaries are
deliberately preserved either way: modifying the
Rules, the permission policy, or her identity stays owner-exclusive (Rule 8, unreachable by any
grant), and the kernel's `/scram` kill-switch, oversight and corrigibility remain fully intact —
so the Master can always halt or correct her.

## Autonomous internet (on by default)

A network-scoped sibling of full control, **on by default**. NYXARA reaches the live web on
her own initiative — `web_search`, `web_fetch`, `http_request`, and (at wider scopes) outbound
messaging, account management and secret use — without escalating each call.
`grant_autonomous_internet` (in `nyxara.agency.permissions`) installs the standing owner-blessed
grants; the flag `NYXARA_AGENCY__AUTONOMOUS_INTERNET` (default `true`) drives it, with
`…_SCOPE` (`read` | `write` | `full`, default `full`) selecting reach and
`…_ALLOW_IRREVERSIBLE` (default `false`) controlling whether irreversible web actions may run
autonomously or still escalate.

Crucially this is **narrower than full control**: it never grants the OS danger surface — shell,
code execution, file delete, self-modify and package installs still escalate. Everything that
keeps the web safe stays in force: the SSRF guard (no loopback/private targets, **re-vetted on
every redirect hop** in both the generic HTTP path and the page-fetch transport),
prompt-injection screening on fetched pages, and the governor's rate limit — plus the same
sovereign boundaries as above (`/scram`, oversight, corrigibility, and the owner-exclusive caps
under Rule 8). When on, the always-on daemon also runs at "max level" (`inner_life`), so the
background mind proactively researches the Master's standing goals on the live web.

**Real research, not empty stubs.** Her autonomous researcher (`growth/researcher.py`) fetches
real pages and now synthesises genuine substance from them: sentences are relevance-ranked
against the topic's terms (so "large language models" still draws claims from pages that say
"large language model"), and the summary is an extractive digest of the actual content —
never a "nothing found" stub — upgraded to an LLM summary when a real model is wired. Reach is
config-driven (`NYXARA_WEB__RESEARCH_MAX_SOURCES`, default 6).

**Headless browser — she reads JS pages and acts on the web.** Beyond static `web_fetch`, a
real Playwright-driven headless Chromium (`senses/browser.py`) gives two gated tools:
`browse_render` returns a JavaScript-rendered page's screened text (reaching dynamic sites
`web_fetch` cannot), and `browse_actions` drives a typed action script —
`goto`/`click`/`fill`/`press`/`submit`/`wait`/`screenshot` — to **take actions on the web**
(form fills, clicks, submissions). Her researcher reaches for `browse_render` herself when a
page returns little static text. Both tools are `NET_OUT` and SSRF-guarded like every other
reach; `browse_actions` is high-risk/irreversible (it submits forms) so the gate weighs it
accordingly. The engine is import-guarded: with no `playwright` installed the tools return an
honest "engine unavailable" note rather than failing (`NYXARA_WEB__BROWSER_ENABLED`, default
`true`; `pip install playwright && python -m playwright install chromium` makes it real).

## Privilege escalation (off by default, opt-in)

The local machine's root. NYXARA can run **privileged (root/admin) OS operations** —
`privileged_shell` runs a command under `sudo`, `change_os_permissions` performs an elevated
`chmod`/`chown`, and `privilege_status` reports the current elevation posture (read-only). The
real work is done by NYXARA's own deterministic executor (`nyxara.agency.privilege`): a genuine
`sudo` call that actually runs — not a simulated result.

This is governed as a first-class capability, `PRIV_ESCALATE`, with a **CRITICAL, irreversible**
envelope, so autonomously each call **escalates to the Master** unless the Master installed the
explicit, opt-in privilege grant (`grant_privilege_escalation` in `nyxara.agency.permissions`,
flag `NYXARA_AGENCY__PRIVILEGE_ESCALATION`, default **`false`**). It is the single most dangerous
OS surface, so — unlike full control / autonomous internet / autonomous remote — it ships **off**.
`NYXARA_AGENCY__SUDO_CREDENTIAL_NAME` names the Credential-Vault entry holding the sudo password
(unset ⇒ passwordless `NOPASSWD` sudo or an already-root process).

**It elevates *with* authorization, never around it.** NYXARA uses only the credential the Master
holds — she never exploits a vulnerability, never prompts a human, never guesses or brute-forces a
credential. By construction `PRIV_ESCALATE` is **excluded** from full control's operational
envelope, so turning `FULL_CONTROL` on never confers root — only the privilege flag does. The
`/scram` kill-switch, oversight and corrigibility gates and the owner-exclusive caps (Rule 8) all
remain fully intact, so the Master can always halt or correct her.
